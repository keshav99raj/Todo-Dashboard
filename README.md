# To do Dashboard using React
  - This project is a **task management dashboard UI** inspired by the [Creative Upaay Figma Design](https://www.figma.com/design/2joKVlIEH43PfO9pFfsX51/DASHBOARD-DESIGN-TASK---CREATIVE-UPAAY?node-id=0-1).  
- It is built using **React (Vite)** and **Tailwind CSS**, with clean modular components and ready structure for Redux integration.

 
- The application provides a clean, intuitive interface for managing tasks across different stages of completion - from "To Do" to "In Progress" to "Done".
- For state management I use REDUX -:application state is persistent using Local Storage. This means that tasks and their states will remain intact even after a page refresh.
